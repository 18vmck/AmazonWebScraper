# AmazonWebScraper-MoreAccurate
A git command line program that searches Amazon and displays the top five results based on a formula for best result and similarity to search query.

This is to be used with a standard bash terminal, either GitBash on Windows or Terminal on mac
    - The code is executed using a personalized git function 'amazon'
    
(!) As of now, need to manually update the personal installation directory for the bash command.
