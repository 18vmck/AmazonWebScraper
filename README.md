### [                   Download for Mac](https://github.com/18vmck/AmazonWebScraper-MoreAccurate/releases/download/v1.0/AmazonWebScraper.Mac.zip)

This is to be used with a standard bash terminal, either GitBash on Windows or Terminal on mac
    - The code is executed using a personalized git function 'amazon'

In the uncompressed zip folder (put it where you want installing to be), the INSTALL.sh script is run using the following bash commands:
                
                bash@AmazonWebScraper(OS):
                   
                    chmod u+x INSTALL.sh   
                    ./INSTALL.sh

This will add the directory as a variable and the command source file to your .bashrc script

Program depends on:
    - Having bash
        - Currently existing .bashrc file / .bash_profile file that sources .bashrc
    - Having Python 3.8 upwards
 
**If it doesn't work immediately reload bash shell, needs to resource .bashrc**
